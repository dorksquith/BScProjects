I was looking through the Masterclass Z-Path on the CERN site over the past week, and made notes of the important information.  
I have read through the Masterclass W-Path on the CERN site , but have not yet made the notes on the important information.
I am planning on reading through and taking notes on Josh's research paper you sent me, as well as take notes on the W-Path site this week.
